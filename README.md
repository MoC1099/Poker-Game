# Poker-Game (Team Leader)
• Managed and presented a program that can generate, evaluate, and compare poker hands. A basic object orientation design was used in the project composed of ArrayLists, and static variables and methods on occasions.

• Managed and assigned part of project to students, depending on their interests and expertise.

• Designed an algorithm that has assigned different variables for each poker hand and cases to evaluate the highest and lowest hand. Program randomly picks 5 different cards from a deck, evaluate them based on their ranks, puts them in an assigned poker hand variable and with the help of case evaluation compares and prints out the wining hand.
